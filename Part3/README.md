Continuing the series.


## Review ⏪
What did we do last time?
- Distinct folders for our TypeScript code and JavaScript code 😇
- Easy way to run our code with one command in package.json 😮‍💨
- Discovered the Boolean type 0️⃣1️⃣
- Comparison operator (==, <, ...) 🤔
- Conditional statements (if/else/else if) 🤯


## Outlook for today 🔭
What are we going to do today?
- More operators with logical operators 🤔
