# Exercise for Intro to TypeScript - Part 4 🤯

Bonus Challenge! - Try to ask as few coding questions as possible (especially syntax) and try to use Google instead (No ChatGPT allowed 😉)

- Create a function "superheroes" that takes an array of Strings named "heroList" as it's parameter
- Inside the function create a for-Loop which loops over the heroList-Array and prints each entry to the console
- Outside the function create the array "dcHeroes" with your favorite DC heroes (i.e. Superman 🦸🏻‍♂️ and Batman 🦇)
- Outside the function create the array "marvelHeroes" with your favorite Marvel heroes (i.e. Thor 🔨 and Hawkeye 🏹)
- Call the function twice with each array as the argument
- .... and that's it
