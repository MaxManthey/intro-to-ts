Bonus Challenge! - Try to ask as few coding questions as possible (especially syntax) and try to use Google instead (No ChatGPT allowed 😉).
Try to start [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/classes.html).

- Create a class "Superhero"
  - Add the properties "name" and "superpower" to the class
  - Add a constructor to the class to initialize the two properties
  - Add a function "sayHello" that logs a greeting and the name to the console
- Create a class "MarvelHero" that inherits from "Superhero"
  - Add the property "isAvenger" to the class
  - Add a constructor to the class with the correct attributes that calls super() and initializes the isAvenger "attribute"
- Create objects of your favorite Marvel heros 🦸‍♀️🦸
