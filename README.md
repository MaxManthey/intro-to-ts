# Intro to TypeScript

I have developed a TypeScript course for you that is being taught live (and most importantly) free on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/arconsis).  
If you have missed any streams, you can always watch the course on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLievaKnl8uRTNBUveXi9TjAjr7y8ndtwV).

## What is [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)?

JavaScript is the language of the web. It is used everywhere from websites (Frontend) to servers (backend).  
TypeScript is the superset of JavaScript. This means that it makes development safer but also adds features to JavaScript.

## So why TypeScript?

TypeScript is continuously rising in popularity. The "State Of JavaScript" Survey proves just that
- TypeScript is by far the most popular [JavaScript Flavour](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/other-tools/#javascript_flavors).  
- People use TypeScript [more](https://2022.stateofjs.com/en-US/usage/) than they use JavaScript.
