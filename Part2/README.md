# Intro to TypeScript - Part 2

Continuing the series.


## Review ⏪
What did we do last time?
- Talked about what TypeScript is and why we are learning it ❓
- Installed Node and VS Code ⬇️
- Setup and ran our first TypeScript project 🔧
- Intro to programming with TypeScript: 🔬
  - console.log()
  - variables (const and let)
  - Two types: String and number


## Outlook for today 🔭

Making things easier: 😮‍💨
- Distinct folders for our TypeScript code and the created JavaScript code 
- Easier way to run our code with just one command instead of two

Diving deeper into TypeScript with: 🤿
- Boolean type
- Comparison operators
- Conditional statements (if/else/ifelse)

Another exercise for Stephan 🏃‍♂️
