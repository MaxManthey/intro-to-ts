# Exercise for Intro to TypeScript - Part 2

- Create a constant variable called "userAge" to represent a user
- Set the variable to a number of your choice
- Let's implement our own bouncer to a bar
  - If the user is younger then 18 print "Sorry but you're too young"
  - If the user is younger then 21 print "If we're in the US, you're still too young"
  - If the user is older then 21 print "Please come in and have a great night!"
